## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `https://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production (also for testing SSR/Pre-rendering locally)
Set environment vairables `SSL_KEY` and `SSL_CERT`.

**`npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr`** - Compiles your application and spins up a Node Express to serve your Universal application on `http://localhost:4000`.

**`npm run build:prerender && npm run serve:prerender`** - Compiles your application and prerenders your applications files, spinning up a demo http-server so you can view it on `http://localhost:8080`
**Note**: To deploy your static site to a static hosting platform you will have to deploy the `dist/browser` folder, rather than the usual `dist`
